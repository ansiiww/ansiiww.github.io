        <h1>About Ingrid</h1>
        <p>
          I am a computer science student at Harvey Mudd College. I am teaching Natural Language Processing and Principles of Computer Science (CS 60, the second course on the path of the computer science major). I completed my PhD under advisor <a href="http://inside.mines.edu/~twilliams/">Dr. Tom Williams</a> in the Department of Computer Science at the Colorado School of Mines in winter of 2021. My research area is human-robot interaction, and my specific interests include verbal noncompliance and clarification interactions, robot ethics, natural language generation (especially pragmatics), robot gender presentation, and mental models of robot identity.

          After graduating from Colorado College in 2016 with a computer science major and a minor in discrete math, I completed my Master's degree in computer science advised by Dr. Tracy Camp at the Colorado School of Mines. For my Master's thesis, I applied machine learning techniques to the task of extracting ostensibly private information from the encrypted traffic between an Amazon Echo and its servers. I then switched research areas to human-robot interaction and began pursuing my doctorate. During grad school, I enjoyed the opportunity to teach and TA for several classes at Mines, including Computer Science 101, Introduction to Linux, and Computer Vision. When I'm not working, I'm climbing rocks.<BR>
