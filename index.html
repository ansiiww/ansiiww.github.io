        <h1>About Ingrid</h1>
        <p>
          I am a fourth-year computer science student at Harvey Mudd College graduating in 2023 Spring.
          My research interests include human-robot interaction and quantum computation.
          Robot ethics, natural language processing, quantum algorithms, and quantum machine learning are among my special interests.

          <BR><BR>
            As an undergrad student, I enjoy the opportunity to research in different labs and explore novel knowledge in different fields. 
            While science intrigues me, I also enjoy emodying innovative ideas through coding to make technology more accessible. 
            I strive to be a research or a software engineer with a clear understanding of the impact of my work on society.   
          <BR><BR>
            I serve to grade and tutor for several classes at Harvey Mudd College, including Principles and Practice of Computer Science, Algorithms, Natural Language Processing and Modern Physics Lab. 
            The TA experience is especially valuable under the influence of COVID for its unique connections with other students.
